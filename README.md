# OpenSimContactForces
OpenSim 4.0 plugin to estimate contact forces based on the work of D. Krueger and S. Wartzack. 
This work is based on the initial implementation by D. Krueger, which did not work for newer OpenSim versions.
It can be particulary useful for estimating ground reaction forces within OpenSim's static optimization.
