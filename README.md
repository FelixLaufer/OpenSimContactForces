# OpenSimContactForces
OpenSim 4.0 plugin to estimate contact forces based on the work of D. Krüger and S. Wartzack. 
This plugin was re-implemented by me based on the initial version provided by D. Krüger, which did not work anymore for newer OpenSim versions.
It can be particulary useful for estimating ground reaction forces during human gait within OpenSim's static optimization.
